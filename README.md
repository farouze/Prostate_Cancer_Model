# Prostate_Cancer_Gene_Expression_Analysis

This project focuses on improving the accuracy and efficiency of differential expression analysis, a crucial method used to identify genes that are differentially expressed between two or more conditions. Specifically, this work involves developing a statistical and computational framework for meta-learning on differential expression analysis.

Project Objectives

Meta-Learning Framework: The project aims to design algorithms that can learn from previous differential expression analyses and apply that knowledge to new datasets. This approach seeks to enhance the predictive power and generalizability of differential expression results.
Biomarker Discovery: By applying the developed framework, the project also aims to discover new biomarkers and identify potential new genes related to prostate cancer, contributing to more accurate and early diagnosis.
Key Features

Statistical Methods: Advanced statistical techniques are employed to improve the detection of differentially expressed genes.
Machine Learning Integration: Machine learning algorithms are integrated into the analysis pipeline to facilitate the meta-learning process.
Prostate Cancer Focus: The primary application of this framework is in the study of prostate cancer, with the goal of identifying new genetic markers associated with the disease.
Future Work

The framework developed in this project is intended to be expanded and adapted for use in other types of differential expression analysis and disease studies, paving the way for broader applications in genomics.
